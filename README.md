-> AquaGuard – Simulated IoT-based Water Management System
Domain: Internet of Things (IoT), Data Analysis, Web/App Development
Water management systems play a critical role in optimizing water usage and preventing
waste, but monitoring such systems in real-time often requires extensive physical
infrastructure and hardware. In this problem, you will focus on simulating the behavior of an
IoT-based water management system that includes sensors for monitoring water flow,
pressure, temperature, and detecting leaks. While students won’t have direct access to
hardware, the problem is designed to simulate sensor data and analyze it using software tools
to model the operation of a real-world water management system.
Your task is to create a software application that simulates an IoT-based water management
system, which collects data from virtual sensors, analyzes trends, and provides
recommendations to improve system efficiency and reduce water loss. This will be achieved
by simulating sensor data over time and using data analytics to predict inefficiencies, such as
leakages or potential failures in the system.
What to Build and How to Present It:
Simulated Sensor Data Generation (200 Points)
The first step is to simulate data from several types of sensors that monitor the water
management system. These sensors will simulate readings for:
○ Water Flow: The amount of water flowing through different pipes in the
system at regular intervals.
○ Pressure: The pressure of water at key points in the system.
○ Temperature: The temperature of water to detect potential issues like
overheating or freezing.
○ Leak Detection: Simulation of leak detection data indicating abnormal drops
in pressure or flow, which may suggest a leakage in the system.
You will develop a program that generates simulated readings for each of these sensors, at
regular intervals, using random or predefined data to mimic a real-time system.
Data Analysis and Visualization (250 Points)
Once the sensor data is generated, your application will analyze the data to identify trends
and patterns. Some key analysis features will include:
○ Identifying peak consumption times by analyzing flow data over time.
○ Detecting pressure drops or temperature anomalies that could indicate a
leak or malfunction.
○ Visualizing the data in real-time through graphs, such as line plots for flow
and pressure, and bar charts for temperature.
This component of the application should allow users to interact with the data, filter by
different time periods, and view trends in an intuitive manner.
Recommendation Engine (100 Points)
Based on the analysis of the simulated sensor data, your system will offer recommendations
for improving the water management system. These could include:
○ Suggestions to reduce water consumption during peak hours.
○ Alerts for potential leaks based on pressure and flow data anomalies.
○ Recommendations for system maintenance, such as checking high-risk areas
for leaks or optimizing temperature settings to prevent pipe damage.
The recommendations should be dynamic, adjusting based on real-time data input, and
provide actionable steps for users to follow.
User Interface (50 Points)
Build a basic command-line interface (CLI) or web-based dashboard that allows users to:
○ View the generated sensor data.
○ Access the analysis results, such as trends, anomalies, and predictions.
○ Receive personalized recommendations based on the data.
The interface should be simple and intuitive, enabling users to interact with the data and
recommendations effectively.
Deploying and Simulating IoT Data
Although there won’t be access to physical hardware, the system is designed to simulate IoT
data, making use of predefined or randomly generated datasets. You can simulate sensor
readings with time stamps at regular intervals (e.g., every minute), mimicking the real-time
flow of data from actual IoT devices.
Deliverables Summary:
The deliverable for this project will be a single software application (either a
command-line interface or a basic web app/mobile app) that simulates the behavior of IoT
sensors in a water management system. The application will include several key features:
first, it will simulate sensor data for water flow, pressure, temperature, and potential leaks at
regular intervals, providing time-stamped records for each data point. The system will collect
and store this simulated data in a structured format, such as a database or arrays. Additionally,
the application will analyze and visualize the data, identifying trends like peak consumption
times, pressure drops, or temperature anomalies that could indicate inefficiencies or leaks.
Based on this analysis, a recommendation engine will provide actionable suggestions to
improve water efficiency, detect potential leaks, and guide system maintenance. Finally, the
app will include a user-friendly interface, either CLI-based or web-based, allowing users to
view the collected data, access analysis reports, and receive personalized recommendations.
The project will be fully integrated into one cohesive application, and while deployment is
optional, it is encouraged for real-time interaction on platforms like Heroku or GitHub Pages.
